            I'm willing to oblige. I'm a person who makes computers do things
            for a living. Sometimes, the computer doesn't really feel like it,
            though. In those instances, I either go for a run, play my guitar,
            read a book or curse creatively in English, Hebrew, Afrikaans or
            Zulu (in rapid decreasing order of fluency after the first 2 [I
            pretend to be a polyglot, but I'm just a lowly bi-glot with
            change]). Or just watch Sopranos, playing{" "}
